Build93 was a fork of Windows93, made by [itspablo](https://app.gitbook.com/u/2Tu3xcOADiPdhk2bnrQwav6Ocqn1). It aimed to make a better Windows93 with a Boot Manager, Package Manager, Control Panel, and many more features. Build93 got released Monday, October 18, 2021. It got shut down by Jankenpopp on Thursday, October 21 for copyright issues.

Build93 will come back soon as an installable JS file.
